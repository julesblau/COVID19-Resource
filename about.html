                    As we all know, there is a lot of information about COVID-19. <br>
                    It was our priority to provide not only the most accurate information possible, but also the most recent. <br>
                    The information used for the national statistics including the information by state came from <a href = "https://covidtracking.com/about-data"> The COVID Tracking Project.</a>
                    <!--The global statistics however, came from <a href = "insertlinkhere">INSERT WEBSITE NAME.</a><br>-->
                    The information for the resources came from various of other websites including<a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/index.html"> The CDC Website</a>
